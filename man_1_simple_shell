.TH HSH 1 "November 2025" "1.0" "Simple Shell Manual"

.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that executes commands read from standard input or from a file. It replicates basic functionality of the
.B sh
shell.

.SH INVOCATION
The shell can be invoked interactively or non-interactively.

.SS Interactive Mode
When
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal, it displays a prompt and waits for commands.

.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ ./hsh
$ /bin/ls
file1 file2
$ exit
$
.RE
.fi

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
Commands can be piped to the shell:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
file1 file2
$
.RE
.fi

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The shell executes commands as follows:
.IP 1. 4
Reads input line
.IP 2. 4
Parses command and arguments
.IP 3. 4
Checks for built-in commands
.IP 4. 4
Searches PATH for executable
.IP 5. 4
Executes command in child process
.IP 6. 4
Waits for completion

.SS PATH Search
If a command does not contain a slash (/), the shell searches directories in the PATH environment variable. If the command contains a slash, it executes the file at that path.
