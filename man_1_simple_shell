.TH HSH 1 "November 2025" "1.0" "Simple Shell Manual"

.SH NAME
hsh \- simple command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[\fIcommand\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. This shell is designed to replicate basic functionality of the sh shell.

.SH OVERVIEW
The simple shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure.

.SH SYNTAX
.B hsh
[\fIcommand_string\fR | \fIfile\fR]

.SH INVOCATION
The shell can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If invoked interactively, the shell displays a prompt ($) and waits for user input.

.SS Interactive Mode
When invoked interactively, the shell displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
file1 file2
($) exit
$
.RE
.fi

.SS Non-Interactive Mode
In non-interactive mode, the shell reads commands from standard input and executes them:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
file1 file2
$
.RE
.fi

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
The shell locates commands in the following manner:
.IP 1. 4
If the command name contains a slash (/), the shell executes the program at the specified path
.IP 2. 4
If the command name does not contain a slash, the shell searches for the command in the PATH environment variable

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are supported:
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
The search path for commands. It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.

.SH EXIT STATUS
Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a non-zero exit status. Otherwise, the shell returns the exit status of the last command executed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Execute a command:
.nf
($) /bin/ls
file1 file2 file3
.fi
.TP
Execute a command with arguments:
.nf
($) /bin/ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 50 Nov 7 10:00 file1
.fi
